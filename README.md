# I'm Manuel Alfredo González Hernández!

I'm a software engineer who loves writing code. I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problems. Even when I leave the office, I tend to continue writing code at the house. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. Some technologies I enjoy working with include  [Angular](https://angular.io/),  [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [ReactJs](https://es.reactjs.org/), and [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).
